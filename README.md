# BuddyUp App - README

## Overview
BuddyUp is a time management and productivity app aimed at enhancing the daily productivity of users by helping them organize tasks, set goals, and manage time effectively. The app integrates intuitive features such as task management, calendar syncing, and productivity reports.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Users can create, prioritize, and manage tasks with reminders and due dates.
- **Calendar Integration**: Seamless synchronization with device calendars to avoid overlapping schedules.
- **Goal Tracking**: Set and track personal goals with a progress indicator to monitor achievements.
- **Productivity Insights**: Get reports and insights on how youâ€™re spending your time and suggestions for improvement.
- **Notifications**: Users receive alerts and reminders for upcoming tasks and deadlines.
- **Collaboration**: Share tasks and projects with friends or colleagues for group management.

## App Design and Architecture
BuddyUp uses **Android Jetpack libraries** to ensure clean and efficient architecture. The design follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture for better separation of concerns, ease of testing, and maintenance.

### Key Components:
- **LiveData**: For observing task and goal data.
- **ViewModel**: Handles the business logic and data management.
- **Room Database**: Local storage of tasks, goals, and user settings.
- **Repository Pattern**: For managing and accessing data from Room and external APIs.
- **Data Binding**: Provides a flexible and efficient way to bind UI components to app data.

## Security
Security is paramount in BuddyUp, particularly when dealing with user task data and calendar integrations. All data is encrypted using **AES-256** encryption when stored locally, and **SSL/TLS** is used for secure transmission.
